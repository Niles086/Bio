        <p>
        I am an accomplished Senior Systems Engineer, an emerging Software Developer, and a proud Military Veteran with a solid foundation in technology. Throughout my career, I've honed my skills in various aspects of IT, including SAAS, IAAS, Physical Infrastructure, and diverse Network Technologies. I've seamlessly integrated Agile methodologies into my work. Additionally, I've cultivated proficiency in HTML, JavaScript, and Python, which have been instrumental in my transition into Software Development. My professional reputation is built on a commitment to collaboration, a people-centric ethos, and a deep sense of compassion, which have enhanced my critical thinking and management capabilities.</p>
        
       <p> I am focused on channeling my talents and strong communication skills into a new organizational opportunity. 
        My remarkable journey from an established Senior Systems Engineer and a proud Military Veteran to an emerging Software Developer was driven by my unwavering passion for technology and my desire to broaden my horizons. It was this innate curiosity and my quest for continuous learning that led me to Code Fellows.
    </p>
<p>In October 2023, I embarked on a transformative experience at Code Fellows, participating in their immersive Software Development program. This rigorous program was instrumental in equipping me with the skills and knowledge needed to excel in the dynamic and fast-paced field of software development.

Throughout the course, I immersed myself in a wide range of programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, and more. The hands-on experience I gained in web development, mobile app development, and software architecture empowered me to confidently tackle real-world problems.

What truly distinguishes the Code Fellows Software Engineering program is its unwavering commitment to fostering a collaborative and inclusive learning environment. I had the privilege of working alongside exceptionally talented classmates and learning from experienced instructors, all of which enriched my problem-solving abilities and cultivated a profound appreciation for the power of teamwork.

Skills Acquired at Code Fellows: HTML, JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Python (Programming Language).
